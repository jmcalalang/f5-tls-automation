Welcome to F5 TLS Automation Documentation!
=============================================

This Project is a derivative of F5's "Automate One Thing" workshops. Its goal is to build a central example repository for Secrets management on F5 products (BIG-IP, NGINX, F5 Cloud Services, etc). Within the solution you will find examples of TLS automation for different integrations across different platforms.
