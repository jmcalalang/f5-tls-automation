Introduction
============

This Project is a derivative of F5s *Automate One Thing* workshop. Its goal is to build a central example repository for Secrets (TLS) management on F5 products (BIG-IP, NGINX, F5 Cloud Services, etc). Within the solution you will find examples of TLS automation for different integrations across different platforms.

(SSL_offloading_) is the process of removing the SSL-based encryption from incoming traffic to relieve a web server of the processing burden of decrypting and/or encrypting traffic sent via SSL. The processing is offloaded to a separate device designed specifically for SSL acceleration or SSL termination.
